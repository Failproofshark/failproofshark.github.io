 <p>I remember it like it was yesterday. It was the fall semester of my senior year in high school. I was eating lunch next to the physics classroom I had coming, when my friend approached me excitedly half walking, half running. </p><p>"Dude, we have got to go to Mr. Daniels' classroom" my friend began with a large grin on his face. My friend was part of the newly reformed school computing club. Apparently, he had caught wind that the library had received a new set of computers, and that they were donating the old computers to the computer club. Mildly interested, and with nothing better to do, I picked up my stuff and joined my friend on his trek to Mr. Daniels' class. </p><p>I was greeted with a large bustle of activity as soon as I entered the class room. I gave a weak "hello" to the few people I knew, as I witnessed students flitting about, rearranging tables to create a sort of clearing in one corner of the classroom. Another, larger group of students formed a circle surrounding a loosely organized pile of computer towers, monitors, and boxes of miscellaneous peripherials and wires. As my friend and I approached the group of students surrounding the heap of computer parts I caught bits of an conversation started long before I arrived. </p><p>"Lets just install ubuntu on them, it's newbie friendly, has a nice GUI right off the bat, and the install process requires very little configuration. Also it doesn't have a root account, just sudo, so no one can screw anything up that badly." one student proclaimed behind his laptop, sitting at a desk opposite where I was standing. Others nodded silently in agreement, and with that huddle broke apart, and the students began to set up the computers on the recently rearranged desks. The student who had his laptop, closed it, then got up started distributing out what looked to be CD sleeves with a a circle of people on them. </p><p>"Oobuntoo?", "gooey?", "root?", "psuedo?" was I in the young computing and technology society or a botany club? Their talk was all greek to me. This must've been readily apparent when I met his excitement with a confusion written all over my face. "We're holding a Linux install fest", my friend explained, "Come on I'll introduce you to the club president". My friend and I approached the person distributing the CD sleeves and introduced me to him. The club president greeted with me a friendly smile and said "always good to have new blood in the club, are you familiar with Linux at all?" Now, before today I had only a passing familiarity with Linux. I had first heard about it soon after my family purchased our first computer some time in '93. My dad had shown me a page in the newspaper about some guy in Finland releasing a free operating system looking to compete with Windows (the Times article was a little misinformed). Not understanding much about computers, at the time, aside from the fact you could use it to type up school reports and occasionally play video games on it, I wasn't all too enthusiastic when I poured over the article with my father. A few years later however, I was interested in programming and computer networking and heard Linux was a good operating system to use for such purposes. I tried to obtain Slackware via "Zip Slack", which was essentially Slackware split across 10 or 11 floppy disks. Downloading that much data on a 28.8k modem however, proved to be an exercise in frustration, so I settled on using a distribution called <a href="http://www.floppix.com/">"floppix"</a>, which was Debian modified to fit on just two floppy disks, quite the feat! Unfortunately, I didn't get very far as I couldn't figure out how to configure the modem. </p><p>I recounted my previous dealings with Linux to which my friend responded with a chuckle and told me that things have changed and getting into Linux has never been easier. Ubuntu, it seems, was a fairly new Linux distribution aimed at lowering the bar of entry; easing the learning curve in order to get more people using Linux on the desktop. The club president then handed me a CD sleeve and told me to take it. My friend then explained to me that there were two cds there, one labeled "live" so I could try it out with committing to anything and another labeled "install" if I decided to install it. </p><p>I was amazed and mystified from the moment I booted up. An operating system, much like windows, and all for free. There were so many new things to explore and I had access to so much of the system, down to the source code that it's made of. Not wanting to deal with dual booting, I decided to quit Windows cold turkey, and just do a full install on my system. Luckily, my family had recently got broadband internet, so I didn't have to deal with configuring a modem, or trying to figure out how to get it to dial out to AOL, MSN or some other awful dial up service. The next day, I told my friend and the computer club president I had installed Linux, to which the club president said "Welcome to the club" then handed me an O'reilly book about Bash, and gave me a few pointers about where to start out. </p><p>From that point on I quickly learned a lot about Linux, and computing in general. There's something about Linux, and the open source community in general that seems to breed an unnatural enthusiasm about technology. I remember picking things up very quickly. I remember trying out different window managers, and soon enough, received an old Pentium III Dell computer from my cousin, and started trying out different distros, even different variations of Unix (mainly BSD). I was pretty active in the Ubuntu community, mainly on IRC, and <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=103806">ocassionally on the forums</a>. I even tried my hand at learning to program with C++, before putting that aside and learning Perl instead. </p><p>I owe a lot to my friends in the computer club, and the open source and Linux community as a whole. It sparked an enthusiasm in me that I had not previously experienced, and even helped me decide on my college major. Come next year in October, I will have used Linux as my primary operating systems for a decade. Since then I have settled to using Arch Linux on the desktop, Debian and Ubuntu on the servers I manage, and learned a great number of programming languages. I really wouldn't be where I am today without them. </p><p>This blog is sort of a testament to that, how far I've come, and how much farther I need to go. I'm not really one to debate about software politics, so I don't expect to be doing a lot of ranting (if ever). I do, however, like to talk about the various projects I'm working on, or ideas I have. Thus, this blog will primarily be about that, one off snippets of code, prototypes, and hopefully more than occasionally, something much more ambitious. I may also write do a few how tos, or quick bits talking about solutions to problems I encounter every now and then. I'm not sure if all of my entries will this "prose-y", or this long, but I guess only time will tell. You can find me <a href="http://www.optimisedbogosort.com">elsewhere on the web</a>. However, you can expect to find a majority of my activity here or on github. With that, I welcome you to my little homely hobbit hole on the internet. Don't mind the stain on the rug (it really holds the place together so I couldn't just toss it), and enjoy your stay. </p>
