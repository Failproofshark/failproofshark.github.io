<h2 class="title">About</h2>
 <h3>About the hands behind the keyboard</h3><p>My name is Bryan Baraoidan. I code mainly for fun, and only coincidentally for profit. I can code in a number of programming languages. The first language I picked up was Perl. Recently, I'm more prone to coding in Lisp, particularly Common Lisp, when left to my own devices. I am an open source enthusiast, having used Linux as my main operating system since my days in high school. My love of programming, computers, and mathematics led me to pursue and obtain a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. </p><h3>About the blog</h3><p>This blog is one part brain dump, one part dev log, and 2 parts syntactic cinnamon sugar. This blog will mainly be about projects I'm working on which may be one off scripts, prototypes, and occasionally something much more ambitious. This isn't the only place you'll find me on the web, however. You can visit <a href="http://www.optimisedbogosort.com">my homepage</a> to find me elsewhere on the information super highway. </p><h3>About Bogosort</h3><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogosort">Bogosort</a>, also known as "bogus sort" or "shotgun sort", is an algorithm that sorts things by randomly shuffling all of the items to be sorted, then checks if it's sorted. This process repeats ad infinitum, until the items are in order. I chose the title, in hopes of convincing people that I might have a sense of humor, or at the very least, a rather odd one. </p>
